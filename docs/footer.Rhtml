    <p> Storytelling has always been a large part of my life, and maps are the best way to capture the physical and conceptual scale of the urban enviornment. I am most interested in urban transportation and public spaces, and I currently exercise these interests as an EV programs intern for Clean Cities Georgia  and as an RA for the Mobility Solutions for Better Health project at Georgia State University.
