    <h3> Welcome to my portfolio! </h3>
    
  <br>
    
    <p> Hello! My name is Eugene, and I am an  urban geographer and cartographer from the greater Atlanta area. Storytelling has always been a large part of my life, and maps are the best way to capture the physical and conceptual scale of the urban enviornment. 
    
  <br>
  <br>
    
    I am most interested in urban transportation and public spaces, and I currently exercise these interests as an EV programs intern for Clean Cities Georgia  and as an RA for the Mobility Solutions for Better Health project at Georgia State University.
